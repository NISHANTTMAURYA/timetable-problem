# The issue was that our college timetable kept changing, making it inefficient to repeatedly search through PDF files to find the current day's schedule. Additionally, the lab timetable was different, adding to the confusion.
# So, I took the initiative to create a responsive website for the students in my branch. 
# The site now allows students to view the timetable up to the scheduled date provided by the college. Upon opening the website, 
# they can instantly see the current and next day's timetable without needing to select a date, and it automatically updates every day. 
# If a specific date is selected, the timetable for that date is displayed. Iâ€™ve also added a PDF of our syllabus,
# ensuring that students have everything they need in one place.
# I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the site, and Python along with Excel to format and edit the CSV data according to our needs. 
# By bringing both the regular and lab timetables into one place, I aimed to simplify the process and make it more efficient for everyone.
